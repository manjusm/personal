One class can define other function as its Friend.
It will have access to all members of the first class including the private memebers.

A good example for friend classes is something like "handle-body" design.

Body defines the Handle as the friend. Handle will have access to all the memebers of the body class.
Body is more like private to the external world and Handle is the public which controls the access to body.
