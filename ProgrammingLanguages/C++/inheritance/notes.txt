1. Base class
2. Derived class

class vehicle 
{
    public:
        int eom;
        string manufacturer;
        string owner;

 }


 class car:
 public vehicle
 {
     public:
     string color;
     int capacity;
 }

C++ provides 3 types of inheritance. Public, Protected and Private.

Protected : protected members are private to the external world but 
            public to the derived class.
